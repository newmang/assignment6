The Facebook API has special support for posting the high scores of games.
It requires an App Access Token to submit scores for a user.

In order to get an App Access Token, your App Secret must be used in the API calls.
To keep your App Secret.. secret, you must NOT do this from the client-side.
PHP is perfect for obtaining an App Access Token.

To allow users to submit high scores, they will have to send a GET request to
a PHP script including their user ID and the score they achieved.

The PHP script can then obtain the App Access Token and post the user's score to Facebook.
